# Unit tests

Sadly, the only working unittests are for the genetic algorithm for molecular optimization.

> :warning: **TODO**: write/fix unittests and remove this todo (old tests prefixed with `_test*`)

## Dataset

The data used for unit testing consists of:

- 3 randomly sampled reaction templates from the Hartenfeller-Button dataset (*rxn_set_hb_test.txt*)
- 100 randomly sampled matching building blocks from Enamine (*building_blocks_matched.csv.gz*)
