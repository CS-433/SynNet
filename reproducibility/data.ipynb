    "    `conda env create -f environment.yml`\n",

    "    `source activate synnet`\n",
    "    On Windows:\n",
    "    `conda activate synnet`\n",
    " 3. Install the project's module\n",
    "    Now that the environment is activated, we need to install the project as a module.\n",
    "    Place yourself in the project's root and run :\n",
    "    `pip install -e .`\n",
    " 4. Restart Jupyter from the new environment\n",
