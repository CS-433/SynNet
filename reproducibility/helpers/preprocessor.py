    This function is equivalent to script/01-filter-building-blocks.py

    The goal is to pre-process the building blocks to identify applicable reactants for each reaction template.
    In other words, filter out all building blocks that do not match any reaction template. There is no need to
    keep them, as they cannot act as reactant.
    In a first step, we match all building blocks with each reaction template.
    In a second step, we save all matched building blocks and a collection of Reactions with their available building
    blocks.
